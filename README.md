# Data-Structure-Repository
My personal Data Structures Repository based on what I know about IT Data Structures. What is here is not an exhaustive list of my knowledge, it is what I have had time to implement so far. Single and Double linked list are in Java as well as Stack and Queue. Queue, priority queue and binary tree are implemented in Python.
